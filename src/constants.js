      👋 Hi, I’m <strong>Lydia Bandy</strong> — software engineer, music composer, and tech educator.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I graduated from <strong>Joy of Coding Academy</strong> (May–Dec 2024) with a strong foundation in 
      <strong>computer science fundamentals</strong> and <strong>data structures in Python</strong>.
      During my internship, I mastered algorithms, built full-stack apps, and solved technical challenges on platforms like 
      <em>HackerRank</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program emphasized both theoretical and hands-on learning — from writing clean, testable code to using 
      <strong>React, TypeScript, and Node.js</strong> in real-world projects. I also gained experience with 
      <strong>GitHub collaboration, version control,</strong> and <strong>unit testing</strong> to ensure production-ready code.
    </p>

    <p>
      My portfolio includes:

        </a> — for my piano students, using <em>Next.js, React, Tailwind, Radix UI, Prisma, MySQL, and Axios</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
